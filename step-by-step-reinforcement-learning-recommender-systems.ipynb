    "- Use [`tensorflow.saved_model.load`](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/api_docs/python/tf_agents/policies/PolicySaver#usage), instead of [`tf_agents.policies.policy_loader.load`](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents/blob/r0.8.0/tf_agents/policies/policy_loader.py#L26), to load the trained policy, because the latter produces an object of type [`SavedModelPyTFEagerPolicy`](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents/blob/402b8aa81ca1b578ec1f687725d4ccb4115386d2/tf_agents/policies/py_tf_eager_policy.py#L137) whose `action()` is not compatible for use here.\n",
    "- Note that prediction requests contain only observation data but not reward. This is because: The prediction task is a standalone request that doesn't require prior knowledge of the system state. Meanwhile, end users only know what they observe at the moment. Reward is a piece of information that comes after the action has been made, so the end users would not have knowledge of said reward. In handling prediction requests, you create a [`TimeStep`](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/api_docs/python/tf_agents/trajectories/TimeStep) object (consisting of `observation`, `reward`, `discount`, `step_type`) using the [`restart()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/api_docs/python/tf_agents/trajectories/restart) function which takes in an `observation`. This function creates the *first* TimeStep in a trajectory of steps, where reward is 0, discount is 1 and step_type is marked as the first timestep. In other words, each prediction request forms the first `TimeStep` in a brand new trajectory.\n",
    "- For the prediction response, avoid using NumPy-typed values; instead, convert them to native Python values using methods such as [`tolist()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.tolist.html) as opposed to `list()`."
